        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Dobrin! I was born and raised in Shumen, Bulgaria but
          am now living in Tatarevo - a village 50km away from Plovdiv. I
          graduated from "Nancho Popovich" high school of natural sciences and
          math after which I moved out to Sofia to have my bachelor's degree in
          Sound Engineering. I had a music band in Sofia for several years but I
          eventually left Sofia and moved to Plovdiv for a cool new job. I love
          nature and hiking in the mountains and in contrast to my city life in
          Sofia and Plovdiv, I'm now living the village life having rediscovered
          myself in gardening. I also became a dad in December-2022 when my son
          was born. I've always had an inclination towards programming but
          something always led me astray (I even started studying a bachelor's
          of mathematics and informatics in Sofia University but dropped out
          because I wanted to study music). My current job was responsible for
          me realising that coding is something that is really interesting and
          exciting to me and a few months ago I started learning how to code.
          I'm really loving it so far and each and every aspect of it. Being
          able to build something out of nothing and see it come to life is
          really satisfying and it's not just the end product that I enjoy
          because I also love the entire process as well - starting from "how
          the hell am I gonna do that?!" all the way through to "oh, my God,
          it's finally working!" with each and every little obstacle and
          challenge all along the way and the satisfaction that comes from
          solving all the little (and big) problems. I'm loving it.

          TLDR: I like music, nature and coding, and I'm a proud dad.
